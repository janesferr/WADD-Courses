		<p>Building good credit is important for many reasons. If you want to finance the purchase of a car or home, you will need to have good credit to qualify. There are several steps you can take to build good credit. Begin by becoming an authorized user on your parent's account. Next, apply for your own credit card with a small line of credit amount. Use the credit card to make small purchases each month and pay off the balance each month. Do not make big, major purchases, unless it is for an emergency. Below are a few more tips to build your credit.
