		<h3>Copyright Law and the Internet</h3>
		<p>Copyright law oversees the use of Internet material. This includes text, images, audio, video, and other illustrations. Many people incorrectly assume that because they can freely access content via the Internet, that the content is in the public domain and therefore free for the taking. This is wrong. Use of copyright material for commercial or personal gain is an infringement. The following is a list of resources pertaining to copyright law and the Internet:</p>
