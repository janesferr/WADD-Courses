    <p>
    I am reading this book to learn how to develop
    websites that can be accessed from any device
    and can serve as cross-platform apps.
     <br>
     The devices I will test will be running the following operating systems:
     <br><br>
     Apple iOS
     <br>
     Google Android
     <br>
     Blackberry OS
     <br>
     Microsoft Windows Phone OS
